# GoodLuck

This project is an ASP.NET Core web application for managing special messages.
It now includes simple pages to keep letters and anniversaries in an
inâ€‘memory database so no files are created on disk.

## Getting Started

1. Ensure .NET 8 SDK is installed.
2. Restore packages with `dotnet restore`.
3. Run the project with `dotnet run`.

### Working with migrations

If you need to create database migrations, first install the EF Core CLI
tool:

```bash
dotnet tool install --global dotnet-ef
```

Then run `dotnet ef migrations add <Name>` from the project directory.

Because the database is in memory, no database file will be generated when
running the application.
